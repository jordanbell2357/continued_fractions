# continued_fractions README

cflib uses standard library only

other modules use standard library and cflib. if they do something that can be compared to cflib, the assertions are in the module

all assertions connecting the non-cflib modules are in integration_testing 

Done:

- Stern–Brocot tree
- Calkin–Wilf tree
- Farey fractions
- Euclidean algorithm
- Bezout coefficients
- Finite continued fractions
- Infinite general continued fractions arbitrary approximations
- Pell's equation
- Infinite periodic continued fractions for real quadratic irrationals of the form sqrt(d) (Aryabhaṭa's kuṭṭaka algorithm)
- Solving congruences
- Adding related functions and sequences
- Chinese remainder theorem
- Infinite periodic continued fractions for arbitrary real quadratic irrationals
- Find matrix transformations to take BQF to reduced BQF

Todo:
- Class number
- Visualizing CW and SB trees, Farey sequences (Farey graph), and displaying continued fractions

Further afield:

- Connections to automata theory
