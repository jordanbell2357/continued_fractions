# Sieve of Eratosthenes

To find the prime numbers the celebrated method of Eratosthenes,
known as his 'sieve,' is employed (I.13.2 ff.). This involves no
mathematical principle of any difficulty, but is, notwithstanding, the
only systematic method of locating them. The odd numbers are conceived as written down; then every third number beyond 3 is stricken
out, every fifth beyond 5, every seventh beyond 7, and so on, leaving
only numbers which are prime; after the multiples of n have been rejected, only prime numbers remain up to $n^2$. Nicomachus makes it
clear that the process consists in discarding multiples.
